Workflow:


August 18th:

	Converted the Rune-Tactics homepage over to NodeJS (Except for Submit button)
	
	Goals for Future: 
		- IMPORTANT: Test upload Next.JS Runetactics home page to see if it renders correctly. If it doesn't, it must be made to work
			before continuing expanding the Next.JS implementation.
			
		- Implement dynamic DOM rendering of components to see if it works (button that loads html)
		- Start by adding a new page for lineup viewing, styling, ect.
		- Install Runeterra JS library
		- Look into dynamic Routing using Next.JS
		- Integrate JavaScript into Next.JS implementation & Test.
		
August 24th:
	Added state to the main page.
	
	To do:
		- Implement button that changes the state of submitted deckCodes to that of the display codes
		- Check that Vercel allows for dynamic HTML rendering 
		- setup Runeterra deck processing.
