Workflow:


August 18th:

	Converted the Rune-Tactics homepage over to NodeJS (Except for Submit button)
	
	Goals for Future: 
		- IMPORTANT: Test upload Next.JS Runetactics home page to see if it renders correctly. If it doesn't, it must be made to work
			before continuing expanding the Next.JS implementation.
			
		- Start by adding a new page for lineup viewing, styling, ect.
		- Install Runeterra JS library
		- Look into dynamic Routing using Next.JS
		- Integrate JavaScript into Next.JS implementation & Test.
